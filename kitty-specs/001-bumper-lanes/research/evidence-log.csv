EV-001,SRC-001,Hooks support JSON responses with decision field,"PreToolUse decisions: allow/deny/ask; PostToolUse decisions: block/undefined; Stop/SubagentStop decisions: block/undefined",critical,Confirmed hook-based architecture with block capability
EV-002,SRC-001,SessionStart hooks can persist environment variables,Any variables written to CLAUDE_ENV_FILE will be available in subsequent bash commands,high,Enables baseline state persistence across hook invocations
EV-003,SRC-002,Temporary index file preserves actual staging area,Using GIT_INDEX_FILE environment variable allows creating tree objects without modifying repository's actual index,critical,Selected non-destructive tree capture method
EV-004,SRC-003,git write-tree creates persistent tree objects,Tree objects can exist independently of commits providing persistent references to filesystem state,critical,Validated tree object approach for baseline storage
EV-005,SRC-006,Untracked files require explicit handling,git ls-files --others --exclude-standard lists untracked files respecting .gitignore,high,Identified need to explicitly include untracked files
EV-006,SRC-008,git diff-tree compares arbitrary tree objects,Supports --numstat and --shortstat flags for machine-readable line counts,critical,Confirmed diff statistics computation method
EV-007,SRC-008,Binary files report as dash in numstat,"Binary files show as - in --numstat output",medium,Need special handling for binary file counting
EV-008,SRC-009,Tree objects persist in .git/objects/,Trees survive git operations like checkout merge rebase once stored,high,Validated baseline persistence durability
EV-009,SRC-001,Hooks execute in parallel when multiple matchers trigger,Parallel execution of all matching hook commands simultaneously,medium,Considered for performance but not applicable (single matcher per hook type)
EV-010,SRC-002,mktemp creates secure temporary files,Standard approach for temporary index files,low,Implementation detail for capture_tree function
