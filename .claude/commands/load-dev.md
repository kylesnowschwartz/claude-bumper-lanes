description: Load the bumper-lanes development framework and skills into context for building
---

Then check for read work:
!`bd ready`

Review what was just accomplished:
!`git log -8`

Review the code structure:
!`eza --tree --level 5 --git-ignore bumper-lanes-plugin/tools/diff-viz`

Then, invoke these skills to load their knowledge into context:
- Skill(effective-go)
- Skill(hud-first)

Then, acknowledge what we're working on, and make a suggestion for what to do next, then wait for user feedback and collaboration and the development resources you have loaded as reference material for the building the suggested work.
